# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

## Project Overview 
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to understand the distribution, relationships, and key characteristics of the dataset.

## Data source
The dataset used in this project is related customer information and can be found on [kaggle](kaggle.com)

## Tools used
- Excel; exvel was used in cleaning the data set
- - **Python**: For data analysis and manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code execution and documentation
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **SciPy/Statistical Libraries**: For statistical analysis

## Data cleaing and preprocessing
- Missing values were identified and handled using appropriate techniques like imputation or removal.
- Outliers were detected using statistical methods and handled to ensure accuracy.
- Data types were checked and converted as needed.
- Duplicates were identified and removed to prevent skewing the analysis.

## Exploratory data analysis
In the EDA phase, several plots and statistical techniques were used to explore the dataset:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual variables (e.g., histograms, box plots).
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps).
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Understanding the interaction between multiple variables.

## Data analysi
```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE
WHERE cond = "NIGERIAN" and state = "Rivers"
limit 5;
```

## Result/ Findings
I discovered there there was a correlation between the student in rula areas and the teachers

## Recommendatsion
More food be available during christmas
